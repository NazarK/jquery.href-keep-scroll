Add class .keep-scroll to any element, now window scroll position should be RESTORED when browser will load new page.
I have made it for links that scroll whole site to top and it doesn't look very well.

<a href="/some/path" class="keep-scroll">link that should NOT reset window scroll position</a>

This feature require jquery.

localStorage is used to save and restore window scroll position.

Supports Turbolinks (Ruby on Rails)
